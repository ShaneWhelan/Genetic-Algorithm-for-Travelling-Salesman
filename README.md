Genetic Algorithm for the Travelling Salesman Problem
============


This project was for my Intelligent Systems (A.I.) module. It was a really fun project where I developed a genetic algorithm for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). I used mutator, crossover, and reproduction operators.

All files are commited including a report, spreadsheet and raw output files (~500mb unzipped!).
